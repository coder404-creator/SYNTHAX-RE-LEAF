# SYNTHAX-RE-LEAF
Hello we are here to solve the probelm of farmer and give them "RE-LEAF" !!

🌱​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Project: Re-Leaf – Smart Crop Monitoring & Irrigation Control

🚜 Problem Statement

- More than 43% of the farmers lose their crops because they do not take good care of them and also because of delayed monitoring.

- Most of the time farmers are far away from their fields, and thus they have no option but to expose themselves to the sun or rain to see the condition of their crops.

- The high cost of agri-tech solutions makes it impossible for small-scale farmers to access smart farming tools.

💡 Our Solution

Re-Leaf is an affordable IoT-based climate tech solution that empowers farmers to remotely monitor and manage their crop growing activities.

The system is always on the lookout for:

- 🌍 Soil moisture(capacitive soil sensor -long-lasting, less resistant to corrosion)

- 🌡️ Temperature & humidity (DHT22 sensor)

- 🌫️ Air quality (MQ135 sensor)

An ESP32 microcontroller powers the whole setup, and it uses the Blynk IoT app to deliver instant alerts to farmers' smartphones.

Additionally, there is an LCD display with live readings for farmers who do not have a smartphone.

⚙️ Tech Stack & Features

- ESP32 – Microcontroller that supports Wi-Fi

- MQ135 – Air quality sensor

- Capacitive soil sensor – Monitoring soil moisture

- DHT22 – temperature & humidity sensor

- Relay module – irrigation pump control

- 🔄 Auto Mode: The pump changes its state to ON/OFF automatically depending on the soil moisture level

- 🎛️ Manual Mode: The farmer has a direct control of the pump to turn it on or off

- Threshold slider in Blynk app – soil moisture limits can be easily customized

- LCD module – offline data display

💰 Cost Efficiency

- The entire building costs ₹700 (~$8)

- Cheap when compared to the ones that are selling for a few thousands

- The farmers just have to take care of the Wi-Fi connection, in that way, it is both accessible and scalable

🌍 Climate Tech Impact

- Efficient water usage: It does not cause over-irrigation and saves water

- Reduced crop loss: Yield is increased through timely alerts and automated irrigation

- A smaller carbon footprint: Cuts down on unnecessary trips to the farm

- Agricultural practices that are climate-resilient: Farmers become stronger in the face of climatic changes

🎯 Why It Stands Out

- ✅ Meets Climate Tech + IoT criteria

- ✅ Solves a real-world problem with low-cost innovation

- ✅ Scalable & inclusive: Works for farmers with or without smartphones

- ✅ Ready for the future: It can become a solar-powered device with functionalities for pest detection, rainfall prediction, ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌etc.

WE USED AI FOR SOME BUGS THAT WAS WITH OUR SOIL SENSOR ALSO WE USED AI TO REFINE THIS READ ME AND MAKE IT SOUND A BIT PROFESSIONAL
