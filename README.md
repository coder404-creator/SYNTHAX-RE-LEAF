# SYNTHAX-RE-LEAF
hello we are here to solve the probelm of farmer and give them "re leaf" 
 our project is simple yet sleek and it solves one of the most important probelm major maintaince crop loss 
over 43 percent of farmer suffer from maintaince crop loss and also sometimesthey live far away hence they walk in the scorching heat or rain to check crops 
our project built to check soil moisture air temperture and humidity and its very cheap as most of farmers cant afford expensive sensors 
we hve used esp 32 as the microcontroler mq135 for air quality resistive soil sensor for soilquality 
dht22 for humidity and temperature  

overall it costs around 700 to build'  
it send notification to phones using blynk 
and this is why we made it cheap because they can pay bit more to install wifi 
suppose they dont ow phone the we have installed a lcd to show live data
